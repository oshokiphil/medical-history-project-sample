# medical-history-project-sample
In my current role, I have had the opportunity to work on several projects that involved the design and development of new features within the Epic EMR system. One of these projects involved creating a feature that allowed physicians to easily view a patient's medication history in a single, consolidated view.

As part of this project, I worked closely with the development team to design and develop the feature using JavaScript. I utilized a number of design tools and technologies to ensure that the feature was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

To create the user interface for the feature, I used a combination of HTML5 and CSS to design a layout that was visually appealing and easy to navigate. I also utilized JavaScript to provide interactivity and ensure that the feature was responsive and easy to use.

A sample code snippet can be found in the medication-history.js file attached to this repo.

This code demonstrates the use of AJAX to retrieve data from the server, as well as the use of JavaScript to update the UI based on that data.

In addition to using JavaScript and other design tools to create this feature, I also worked closely with the QA team to ensure that the feature was thoroughly tested and met all quality standards. Overall, this project was a great example of my ability to design and develop new features within the healthcare industry, and I am excited to bring these skills to an organization.
